Responsive Portfolio Assignment, week 02

## The Assignment
Create 3 responsive-layout pages for a "portfolio", including an about page, a portfolio page with a couple images, and a contact page with a (non-working) form. All the pages needed to be responsive, of course, and one of the bonus options was to create a 'sticky' footer.

### Results
For my about page, I included a 'social media' section and a stanza from a poem I like instead of trying to write up a 'personal marketing blurb'. The image is from https://picsum.photos.

The images (and the gif) on the portfolio page are renders of some 3D models I've made in Blender over the last few months. Clicking on an image opens it larger in a modal window. I tried to disable the modals on mobile and couldn't figure it out; I'll come back to that later. The gif has a button at the bottom that opens the original video file in a new tab.

The form on the contact page doesn't work, of course, but the inputs are correct for what type they are (name, email, textarea for the message). I set up a tidbit of JS to pop up an alert when the submit button is clicked, warning the user that the form doesn't actually work.

The rainbow bar along the bottom of the content sections on each page is actually a div with a linear-gradient background. That was just for fun -- absolutely no bearing on anything, really.
